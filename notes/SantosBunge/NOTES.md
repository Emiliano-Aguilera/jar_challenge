# SantosBunge's notes

Module: deteccion and fusion (perception). Who keeps which one is still to be agreed
with Emiliano-Aguilera; this branch implements both so either split works.

Code: `src/equipo_jar/equipo_jar/vision.py` (image, LiDAR and geometry math),
`deteccion.py` (node), `candidate_fusion.py` (fusion math), `fusion.py` (node).
Tunables: sections `deteccion` and `fusion` of `src/equipo_jar/params/params.yaml`.
Every tunable has a `#PARAM:` comment with what it does and its valid range.

One entry per decision: the question, what was tried, what was decided.

## How does detection measure the distance to a box?

- Tried: the depth cloud as the main source (median of the cloud points inside the red
  blob). It works in Gazebo, but the real robot's cloud is valid only from 0.6 m, has
  ~38 % valid pixels and gaps of up to a second (team CLAUDE.md).
- Decided: LiDAR first. The rays through the left and right edges of the red blob are
  taken to the LiDAR frame, the beams inside that wedge are selected, and the nearest
  cluster (everything within 0.30 m of the closest beam) is the box face. The LiDAR
  plane (0.18 m) cuts the 0.30 m tall box, so it always sees it. The cloud is only a
  fallback when the wedge has no beams.

## How are the camera and the LiDAR aligned in time?

- Problem: the camera runs at 30 Hz, the LiDAR at ~7 Hz with ~136 ms latency. While the
  robot turns at 1 rad/s, 100 ms is 10 cm at 1 m.
- Decided: pair image and scan with `ApproximateTimeSynchronizer` (0.1 s), and take the
  camera rays to the LiDAR frame with `lookup_transform_full` through `odom`, which
  applies the robot's motion between the two timestamps. Everything downstream uses the
  scan's timestamp.

## Face or center?

- The sensors see the front face; the judge scores the center, 0.125 m behind it for a
  0.25 m box. Half the 100-point radius.
- Decided: in the robot frame, shift the face point half a side along the line of
  sight (`center_from_face`). `box_side_m` = 0.25 from the simulator; the real size is
  a pending question to the organizers.

## What does detection hand to fusion?

- Options: a new message in `equipo_jar_msgs` (needs an interface PR) or a standard one.
- Decided: `/jar/observaciones` as `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` in `map`,
  one per box per frame. Position = center estimate; `covariance[0] = covariance[7] =
  sigma^2`, with `sigma = 0.05 + 0.03 * distance`; stamp = scan time. Fusion looks up
  the robot pose at that stamp itself. No new message type needed.

## What covariance does fusion report?

- Mission (AlsinaBautista) filters on `observaciones >= 5` and on the std along the
  worst direction (largest eigenvalue of `covarianza_xy`) `<= 0.10 m`, and wants every
  candidate, doubtful ones too, with an honest covariance.
- Decided: `cov = S / n + I / W`, where `I / W` is the covariance of the weighted mean
  (weights `1 / sigma^2`) and `S` the weighted sample covariance of the observations
  (so an elongated cloud gives an elongated ellipse). Plus a floor: while the robot poses
  the candidate was seen from span less than 0.3 m, the diagonal is at least 0.15^2.
  Ten frames of a reflection from one spot would otherwise look very precise; the floor
  keeps them above mission's 0.10 m until a second viewpoint confirms them.

## Do candidates ever disappear or merge?

- Decided: two candidates closer than 0.3 m merge and the lower id survives (as
  `Candidata.msg` promises). A candidate with fewer than 5 observations and nothing new
  for 20 s is dropped. Candidates with 5 or more observations are never dropped.

## Parameters

- Decided: all tunables go through `comun.parametros_en_vivo` and are read from the
  dict at use time, so they apply during a live session. Two exceptions, read at
  startup: `sync_tolerance_s` (the synchronizer is built once) and `publish_debug`.
- HSV bounds are lists of 3 (the CI rejects numeric lists of 4 or more).

## Which dependencies?

- Tried: cv_bridge and python3-opencv as rosdep (apt) dependencies. The first run on the
  simulation server died at container start right after the build (batch
  20261022-130550-3826108, `rc docker`, 0 s), most likely because those apt packages are
  not in the server's base image and the install failed.
- Decided: no cv_bridge (images decoded with numpy in `vision.decode_image`, bgr8/rgb8)
  and OpenCV from pip (`opencv-python-headless==4.9.0.80` in `requirements.txt`, the
  path the template documents). The remaining `package.xml` additions
  (tf2_geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs_py, message_filters, numpy) ship with ros-base.

## Robot facts checked in the simulator repo (yahboom_rosmaster @ jar2026-v1, 2026-10-22)

- Camera: `cam_1_color_optical_frame`, 320x240 `rgb8`, fx = fy = 271.809, cx = 158.719,
  cy = 120.092, mounted level (rpy 0 0 0) at x = 0.057 m, z = 0.0376 m above base_link
  (0.107 m above the floor). The macro default pitch of 0.5 rad is not used.
- LiDAR: `laser_link` at x = 0.0435, z = 0.11 m above base_link (0.18 m above the floor),
  yaw = pi. base_link is 0.0714 m above base_footprint.
- Depth cloud: frame `cam_1_depth_frame` (x forward, not an optical frame), unorganized,
  valid from 0.6 m, ~38 % valid points. The fallback therefore moves the cloud into the
  color optical frame with TF before projecting it with K (`_cloud_as_image`).
- Boxes in the practice worlds: 0.25 x 0.25 x 0.30 m, red diffuse (0.8, 0.05, 0.05),
  blue distractors (0.05, 0.05, 0.8). Pure hue, so the HSV ranges hold.

## First measurement in the simulator (session 20261022-140046, maze_1_6x5, teleop)

- Setup: `pruebas.launch.py` (map = odom fixed), robot driven by hand to both red boxes
  and past a blue one, 9 min recording. Evaluated offline with
  `notes/SantosBunge/analyze_bag.py`, which removes the odometry drift using the
  simulator's ground truth (offline only, never in `src/`).
- Detection error, drift removed: median 0.022 m (p90 0.027) on box 1 (572 obs,
  0.4-1.0 m) and 0.016 m (p90 0.022) on box 2 (62 obs, 0.7-1.8 m). Radial bias under
  1 cm: the face-to-center shift of 0.125 m is right. Zero observations near the blue
  boxes, zero farther than 0.5 m from a red box.
- As published (with drift): 0.19 m and 0.36 m. That is the mecanum odometry drifting
  during a few minutes of teleop. Localization has to close it; detection cannot.
- Reported sigma is conservative: |error| / sigma ≈ 0.2-0.3 in the simulator. Left as is
  (the real camera and LiDAR are noisier); mission's 0.10 m threshold is still met after
  a handful of observations once the robot has moved 0.3 m.
- Fusion: two candidates, ids 1 and 2, stable for the whole session, never merged.
  Candidate 1 became reportable only after the robot moved (single-view floor), as
  designed.

## False reports: a wall corner in front of a distant box (2026-10-25 runs)

- Evidence (hans-die's notes and his write-up of 2026-10-25): on two practice maps mission
  reported a point with no red box near it, 3 of 3 runs on one of them. Each false point lay
  on the bearing of a real red box but ~1 m closer, and the robot moved away along that
  bearing, so the observations agreed with each other and passed mission's rule
  (5 observations, std <= 0.10). Cost: -100 for the missed box and the -200 fast bonus.
- Cause: `nearest_cluster` took the nearest LiDAR points in the whole blob wedge (plus a
  0.03 rad margin). When a box peeks past a wall corner, the corner sits at the edge of the
  blob and is the nearest thing in the wedge, so the range was the corner's. The corner is a
  real point in space, so more viewpoints do not expose it: a geometric fix is needed, not
  a statistical one.
- Decided, three independent defenses in `deteccion` (each alone catches the known cases):
  1. `central_cluster`: only the beams in the central 60 % of the blob's angular span, no
     margin, grouped by range; the largest group wins and must cover >= 60 % of those
     beams. The box always fills the center of its own blob, and that line of sight is free.
  2. `width_is_consistent`: the blob's pixel width must match a 0.25 m box at the LiDAR
     range (ratio in [0.6, 1.8]). A corner 1 m in front of a box at 3 m gives ~0.5. Costs the
     views where the box is more than 40 % hidden, which other viewpoints recover.
  3. `map_range_along`: the LiDAR hit must not lie on a wall of `/map` (within 0.15 m of the
     map's own range along that bearing). Boxes are not drawn in the practice maps. If the
     competition map draws them, a mapped obstacle smaller than 0.40 m is spared, and
     `map_wall_check: false` turns it off (params only, allowed after the cutoff).
  Plus `max_range_m: 3.0`: coverage looks from 2.0 m, and far observations are the
  ambiguous ones.
- Not done: a perpendicular-baseline rule in fusion. The corner is a real point, so it is
  consistent from every viewpoint; the baseline would not have helped.
- Validation: see the next entry (replays of the recorded runs).

## Next

- Repeat the measurement with localization (AMCL) instead of the fixed map = odom.
- Decide with the team whether to tighten `obs_sigma_*` after seeing the real robot.
- Confirm with AlsinaBautista that the 0.15 m single-view floor fits mission's policy.

## Testing without the simulator

- `notes/SantosBunge/fake_sensors.py`: publishes static TF, camera_info, a 320x240 image
  with a red rectangle and a 1080-beam scan for a box 2.0 m ahead, then prints the
  observations and candidates it gets back. Run `deteccion` and `fusion` with
  `params.yaml`, then `python3 notes/SantosBunge/fake_sensors.py 12`. Expected center
  (2.0, 0.0); with the robot still, the candidate std stays at the 0.15 m floor.
- Unit tests (no ROS): `src/equipo_jar/test/test_vision.py`, `test_candidate_fusion.py`.
