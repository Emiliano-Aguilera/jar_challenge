"""Trip back to the start in legs (no ROS here).

Nav2's NavFn planner (Humble) stops building its path after 4 x the costmap's longer side
in cells, about half a cell per step, so a path longer than ~2 x the map's side always
fails ("Failed to create plan from potential"). The limit is in Nav2's code, not a
parameter, and retrying the same goal fails the same way. For a long way back, mission
finds the way on /map itself and sends it to Nav2 in legs it can plan.

The way back is a breadth-first search over the cells where the robot fits
(`Grid.safe_cells`), moving only along x and y. Its length is never shorter than the
real path, so a leg of `leg_m` is at most that long for Nav2. Mission runs it on Nav2's
global costmap when it has one (boxes and obstacles the LiDAR saw, which /map lacks;
radius 0, since the inflation already holds the robot), and on /map otherwise.
