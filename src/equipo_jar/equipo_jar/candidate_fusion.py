"""Observation fusion, no ROS: from many noisy detections to a few candidates with an
averaged position and an honest 2x2 covariance.

This is the math behind the `fusion` node. Mission (docs/team/INTERFACES.md) receives every
candidate and decides what to report; it filters on `observaciones` and on the largest
eigenvalue of `covarianza_xy`. So the job here is not to say "confirmed" but to make the
count and the covariance truthful.

Model
-----
Each observation k is a point z_k = (x, y) in `map` with standard deviation sigma_k
(set by detection from the distance). Weight w_k = 1 / sigma_k^2.

Association: z_k joins the closest candidate within `association_dist`; otherwise it
opens a new one. After the update, two candidates closer than `merge_dist` are merged
(the lower id survives, as Candidata.msg promises).

Update (recursive weighted mean, i.e. a static Kalman filter with R_k = sigma_k^2 I):

    mu  <-  (W mu + w_k z_k) / (W + w_k),      W <- W + w_k

Covariance reported for the candidate, 2x2:

    cov = S / n  +  I / W

  - I / W is the covariance of the mean if every observation were independent with its
    own sigma_k: it shrinks as 1/n.
  - S is the weighted sample covariance of the observations around mu (West's online
    algorithm). S / n adds what the observations themselves disagree about, with their
    real shape (an elongated cloud gives an elongated ellipse).
  - Single-viewpoint floor: while the robot poses the candidate was seen from span less
    than `min_baseline`, the diagonal is raised to at least `single_view_sigma^2`. Many
    frames from one spot share the same systematic error (a reflection, a bad range), so
    the covariance must not shrink until a second viewpoint confirms the position.

Purge: a candidate with fewer than `min_obs_to_keep` observations and nothing new for
`stale_timeout_s` is dropped: decoys and stains seen a few times from one place.
