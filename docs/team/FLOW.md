# Workflow

## Branches

| Branch | What for |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | The delivery. Same as the organizers' repo until we deliver. |
| `interfaces` | Agreeing on the interfaces between modules. Reviewed in its PR, which is **not merged**. |
| `development` | Created from `interfaces` once the interfaces are agreed. The fork's default branch: modules come together here. |
| `<module>/<task>` | Each person's work, e.g. `deteccion/segmentacion-hsv`. Branches off `development` and goes back by PR. |

Module prefixes: `localizacion`, `navegacion`, `cobertura`, `deteccion`,
`fusion`, `mision`. Owners are in the root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Steps

1. **Interfaces:** everyone reviews [`INTERFACES.md`](INTERFACES.md) from their
   module and comments on the `interfaces` PR.
2. **Development:** once agreed, `development` is created from `interfaces`,
   made the default branch, and the PR is closed without merging.
3. **Modules:**
   - New task: `git switch development && git pull`, then create `<module>/<task>`.
   - Small changes. Before the PR: build, run `bash tools/verificar.sh --template`
     (or the fork CI), and test in simulation.
   - PR to `development`, merged by its author once CI is green and it works in
     simulation. No review needed, except interface changes (see
     [`INTERFACES.md`](INTERFACES.md)).
   - Branches live 1–3 days, even if the module is not finished. Pull
     `development` into your branch often. Delete the branch after the merge.
4. **Delivery:** `development` is merged into `main` as **one squash commit**
   that leaves out everything internal (see below).

`development` must always build, launch and score. A node that doesn't work yet
is merged anyway, but kept out of `competencia.launch.py`.

## Checks

- **Compliance is checked by CI.** The organizers' CI runs on every PR to
  `development`: the delivery checks on the code we would deliver, except that
  `equipo.yaml` may still be unfilled.
- **Batch runs on the simulation server measure behaviour** (score, time,
  recordings). They skip the organizers' interface audit: our recorder there
  triggers false failures. A green batch doesn't mean CI passes. How to use
  the server: [`SIMULATION.md`](SIMULATION.md).
- **Before the delivery,** `bash tools/verificar.sh` without `--template` must
  pass (it also checks that `equipo.yaml` is filled in). Run it from time to
  time, not only at the end.

## What the final squash leaves out

The squash into `main` removes:

- `notes/` and `docs/team/`;
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/` (team-only; `CLAUDE.md` lists our
  GitHub users, and the delivery must not carry personal data);
- our workflows in `.github/workflows/` (keep the organizers' two). A delivery
  PR that touches `.github/` is not published to the practice leaderboard.

Simulation-server infrastructure (bridge, recorder, session launch and scripts)
never goes in `competencia.launch.py`. Live-parameter callbacks in our nodes
can stay.

## Personal notes

Each member has a folder in [`notes/`](../../notes/) with `AGENT.md`: context
for their AI agent. Each person writes only in their own folder, so there are
no conflicts.

The JAR 2026 working notes (each module's `NOTES.md` with its decisions,
reports and helper scripts) left the tree after the competition. They are in
the tag `archive/pre-cleanup`, e.g.
`git show archive/pre-cleanup:notes/hans-die/NOTES.md`.

Agents read their user's `notes/<GitHub user>/AGENT.md` at the start of each
session (the root `CLAUDE.md` says so). Don't create a `CLAUDE.local.md`.

## Rules

- **No agent attribution:** no commit or PR carries an agent's
  `Co-Authored-By` or lines like "Generated with …".
- **Don't touch `tools/` or the organizers' workflows.**
- **Don't edit our workflows (`simular.yml`, `sesion.yml`) either:** they run on the team's
  simulation server, which refuses any version its owner hasn't reviewed. Ask
  Emiliano-Aguilera.
- **`equipo.yaml` is filled in before the delivery PR** to the organizers.
- The CI rules that are easy to break are in the root `CLAUDE.md`
  ("CI and delivery traps").
